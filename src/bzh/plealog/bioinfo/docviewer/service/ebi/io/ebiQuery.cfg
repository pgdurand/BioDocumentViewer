#
# Number of sequences to retrieve per batch connection
# From EBI Web service documentation (See http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/webservices/help/faq)
# it is not quite clear how many sequences we can retrieve per connection.
# It seems that 100 is ok...
sequences.per.run=100

#
# Number of letters to retrieve per batch connection
#
letters.per.run=5000000

#
# Sleep time between two successive connections (unit is millisecond)
# 1000ms = 1s: please, follow EBI recommendations. 
#   Not doing that: you (and even your entire Institute) can be black-listed by the EBI!
#   See http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/webservices/help/faq

sleep.per.run=1000
